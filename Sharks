        cookiecutter shark gets its name from the cookie-shaped bite wounds it
        leaves on its prey. The shark’s unique teeth and short, coned snout
        create these round chunks. It will attach itself to a tuna,
        marlin,stingray, another shark, or even a whale, by suctioning its lips
        to the body of the animal. Then, the shark spins its body, using it’s
        lower set of serrated teeth like a can opener to remove a hunk of flesh,
        resulting in a wound that lives up to the shark’s name.

      <p>
        The lemon shark’s yellow skin color provides perfect camouflage against
        sandy in-shore areas where it often forages for food. This, along
        withthe shark’s flattened head and short snout, makes the lemon shark a
        skillful predator of bony fish, crustaceans and stingrays.
        Occasionally,this species will also be observed eating seabirds or
        smaller sharks. An adult lemon shark may grow to be 10 feet long, making
        it one of the larger species of sharks in our oceans.<br />The lemon
        shark is viviparous, meaning it gives birth to live young rather than
        eggs, this also means they have bellybuttons. Embryos develop inside the
        mother for up to 12 months until the female seeks shelter in a shallow
        nursery during spring or summer to give birth. A litter of lemon sharks
        may be as large as 17 pups. Pups remain in thenursery for several years,
        sheltered from larger predators, and feed on nutrients from nearby
        mangroves. Some are even known to make friends with other sharks in
        these nurseries -
